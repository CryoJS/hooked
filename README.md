# Hooked
An interactive experience exploring how algorithm-driven platforms exploit attention, productivity, and well-being.

## What Is Hooked?
Hooked is a hybrid of a game and article. It places you in the role of a student trying to stay productive while navigating an endlessly tempting algorithmic feed.

## How to Play the Game
1. Try your best to do as much work as possible
2. All while managing screen time
3. Game over when satisfaction hits zero, or harm reaches 100%
